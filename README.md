# arduino-tft-alarm-clock
A school assignment meant to simulate a simple alarm clock on a TFT LCD touch screen and an Arduino Uno.

Unfortunately, as the screen blocks any other inputs without actually soldering on something, we were not able to connect a Real Time Click.
Instead, we just simulate time by incrementing a hour, minute and second value.

It has an activate/deactivate button, a status text and shows the ticking time above.
